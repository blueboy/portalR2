MangosR2 README

MangosR2 is a free, open source MMORPG Framework based mostly on C++.
open source, and is community supported. It is derived from MaNGOS, 
the Massive Network Game Object Server. Currently supported client

MangosR2 is not a separate project. This is a fork of the "MaNGOS project" and 
"ScriptDev2 project" intended to test the new code, which for some reason was 
not accepted (or will never be accepted) to those projects.
R2 tries to take the best from MaNGOS, TrinityCore and other projects, while 
trying to preserve consistency and simplicity of MaNGOS code.

Unfortunately, at the beginning of the 2011, those projects left almost all 
experienced developers, and they have practically ceased to grow. 
I commend the people who still continue to develop original projects repository, 
but the level of development is clearly inadequate and not always competent, 
in addition, the code of the original project practically not tested and 
may cause problems while real usage.
